libmkcal (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some reference counting issues (now keeping all event/journal/todos in mIncidences QSet, even during updates), and also fixed recurrence id checks in insertEvent/Journal/Todo.
  * Added removal of calendar observer to the destructor -> this way there won't be issues after storage is gone but calendar still hangs around.
  * Added .gitignore.
  * Added environment variable to turn off tracker.
  * Fixed recurrence expansion.
  * Based on today's discussion - uid is now immutable so we don't really play around with mTodos/mEvents/mJournals and therefore mIncidences is no longer needed.
  * Made incidenceUpdate(+d) have recurrenceId parameter, and converted the relevant code to use it. Also added recurrenceId() virtual to IncidenceBase.
